As of today (May 10, 2023) we have just reached 1,000 members in our English-language [**Delphi Developer Group**](https://t.me/delphidevelopers) on Telegram! (The Brazilian [**Delphi BR Group**](https://t.me/DelphiBR) is probably the largest Delphi group on Telegram...but we are slowly catching up!)

We have an active question and answer chat on just about any Delphi-related topic and everyone is invited to join. I created the group in early 2021 and typically include an invite link on every blog post here. You are all cordially invited to [**join us**](https://t.me/delphidevelopers) online!

There are three other group moderators that are the most active members of the community. **Dave Nottage** was also the very first member of the group!

A big **thank-you** out to the Moderators and to all of the users that have stopped by our group!
