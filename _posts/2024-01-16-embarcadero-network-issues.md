There has been persistent connectivity issues recently to Embarcadero websites including their [DocWiki](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com), [Quality Portal](https://quality.embarcadero.com/) and others.  The issue is being actively discussed in multiple channels including on Telegram and Facebook.  There are apparently some underlying infrastructure issues that they have been chasing and you should look for an official announcement soon.

`Ian Barker` posted a quick update on Telegram this morning
