ChatGPT is still going strong - let's celebrate Delphi with a rock-n-roll song!

(Verse 1)

In the realm of code where wizards dwell, There's a tool that casts its magical spell, Delphi, the rockstar of development might, Cross-platform prowess shining so bright.

(Chorus)

Delphi, the conqueror of platforms far and wide, A symphony of power, our development guide, From Windows to Linux, Mac, and beyond, Delphi stands tall, forever strong.

(Verse 2)

With Delphi's might, we craft with ease, Windows applications, a breeze in the breeze, But wait, there's more, a story untold, Linux, macOS, we conquer, bold.

(Chorus)

Delphi, the conqueror of platforms far and wide, A symphony of power, our development guide, From Windows to Linux, Mac, and beyond, Delphi stands tall, forever strong.

(Bridge)

iOS and Android, we reach for the sky, Delphi's embrace, we'll never say goodbye, A single codebase, our dreams take flight, Delphi unites us, in the endless night.

(Chorus)

Delphi, the conqueror of platforms far and wide, A symphony of power, our development guide, From Windows to Linux, Mac, and beyond, Delphi stands tall, forever strong.

(Verse 3)

Oh, Delphi, the legacy we adore, Decades of excellence, forevermore, With rapid design and performance grand, Delphi, the king of the coding land.

(Chorus)

Delphi, the conqueror of platforms far and wide, A symphony of power, our development guide, From Windows to Linux, Mac, and beyond, Delphi stands tall, forever strong.

(Outro)

So let the rock-n-roll of Delphi resound, A celebration of its triumph profound, Raise your hands high, let the chorus roar, Delphi, the legend forevermore.

### Update:
I asked ChatGPT for to generate chords for the lyrics above:
````
Certainly! Here's a suggestion for the chord progression:
(Verse/Chorus) Dm - C - G - Am
(Bridge) F - G - C - Am
(Outro) Dm - C - G - Am

You can strum these chords in a rock style, using power chords or full chords depending on the intensity you want to achieve. Experiment with different strumming patterns and variations to make the song your own. Enjoy rocking out with your Delphi anthem!
