The first in a series of challenges for the RAD Studio developer community **now has a winner**!  18 contestants supplied their own version of Minesweeper, written in the latest version of [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) in either [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) or [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder).  All of their repositories were forked to a new `RAD Programmer Challenge 1` organization on GitHub: [https://github.com/radprogrammer-challenge1-entries](https://github.com/radprogrammer-challenge1-entries)  Each contestant will be invited to this new organization as a way to signal their participation as a small minesweeper image will show up on their user profile page under the Organizations section.

## Winner - Jaques Nascimento


The winner by popular demand is **Jaques Nascimento** as GitHub user: [ImperiumDelphi](https://github.com/ImperiumDelphi)  

A lot of effort was put into this game with animations, sounds, and multiple game play variations.  It is also one of only two games that were listed on the Google Play Store which was a large bonus.

The judging was tough - I initially favored **HemulGM**'s MineSweeperFMX when it was first entered.  Then jumped to **Jim McKeeth**'s hex-board layout which is really cool and unique.  (**Andonis Munoz** also has a very unique game board selections.)  I really enjoyed **Arbrito**'s game on the Google Play store and his artwork was great. And **Mohammad Qadiany**'s MineSweeper 2025 is a runner up due to its unique functionality, but the **GitHub Stars** win out this time.  

Besides an overwhelming win in Stars, and the additional bonus of getting listed on Google Play, there were a few unique game play features including a "Radar" that very briefly shows mine placement, and a "Safe Play" option.
