description: "Take the Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey today and give Delphi a boost"
---
The 15th annual developer survey from Stack Overflow includes options to select [**Delphi**](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and the ability to write in [**RAD Studio**](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio). This is a very popular survey within the developer community with nearly 70,000 developers participating last year - so please boost visibility of the RAD Studio developer by participating!

As usual, you do not have to be an active Stack Overflow member to take the survey and the answers are all anonymous. [**Here is a link to the survey**](https://stackoverflow.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1MNG2CYTY2AzkAm). It takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.

## Complete the survey today

Based on previous years performance, I will estimate that this blog post will get (at least) twice as many views as the total number of respondents selecting Delphi as their dev tool of choice in the survey - which makes no sense!   So please stop what are you doing and [take the survey now](https://stackoverflow.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1MNG2CYTY2AzkAm) and pick Delphi when prompted.  It's really quick to do and it can help increase visibility of the language. Don't rely on the next person to do it. 

When you are done, share the link with everyone you know and ask them to do the same.  Let's shift perspectives and drive a significantly better result in the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey!
