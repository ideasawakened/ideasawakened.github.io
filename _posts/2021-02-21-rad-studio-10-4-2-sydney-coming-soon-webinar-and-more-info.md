There's a [**Roadmap Page**](https://github.com/ideasawakened/DelphiKB/wiki/Future-Releases-for-RAD-Studio-and-Delphi) available from our [**Master Release List**](https://github.com/ideasawakened/DelphiKB/wiki/Delphi-Master-Release-List) wiki page on GitHub which covers all updates from 10.3 and later. This roadmap page has links and screen captures of information regarding the upcoming release. Below is the latest roadmap image from Embarcadero:

All RAD Studio customers with an active subscription were [**invited to Beta test**](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/delphi-and-cbuilder-10-4-2-beta-invite-for-update-subscription-customers/) the 10.4.2 release back in December, codenamed "Hunter". After a few months of beta testing, based on the scheduled webinar, it seems like we are close to release! Updates planned for [**10.4.2**](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/tag/10-4-2/) include:

**Platform Enhancements**

-   Complete platform support: iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 (Delphi and C++)
    
-   Complete platform support: macOS 11.0 Big Sur - Intel (Delphi) (ARM support targeted for 10.5)
    
-   Complete platform support: Android 11 (Delphi)
    
-   MSIX app packaging format support
    
-   New VCL Native Windows Control: An optimized virtual list view for infinite scroll which also supports Live Bindings
    
-   New VCL Native Windows Control: A numeric input control modeled after the WinUI NumberBox platform control
    
-   FMX enhancements including more work on TMemo and reworked sensor management in Android
    

**User Experience Enhancements**

-   Form Designer and Code Editor windows editable at the same time (which compensates for the undocked designer which was removed in 10.4.1)
    
-   New IDE Theme named _Mist_ which utilizes classic IDE colors (gray instead of blue)
    
-   Migration Tool Enhancements - added specific preset configurations and now handles configuration files as well as registry entries
    
-   LSP based Code Insight performance and new feature improvements which completes the LSP upgrade effort
    
-   High DPI Support improved in the IDE in 10.4.2 (final stages planned for 10.5)
    

**Quality Improvements**

-   The recent releases have focused on closing many open bug reports. 10.4.2 will continue this quality focus with specific areas targeted:

As one user commented on this blog the other day, **Embarcadero is Making Delphi Great Again!** I personally think it was always great, but they have been truly focusing on improving the core functionality of the product while keeping up with the cross-platform support.

If you have been waiting to [**upgrade**](https://www.embarcadero.com/radoffer) your ancient copy of Delphi, now may be a really great time to consider it!

(United Kingdom, Netherlands and Turkey are the next three most popular visitors.) **Welcome** to everyone!
