If you are using the Community Edition of RAD Studio, then you may be interested in this offer with up to 55% of savings.

_Note: I am not associated with Embarcadero sales, nor do I get a commission of any kind. I am simply passing on correspondence received today which I thought included an impressive discount._ It's simply a positive action for everyone in the Delphi community to help promote its growth.
