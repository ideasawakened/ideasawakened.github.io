Everyone seems to be talking about ChatGPT these days, so here's a nice poem about our favorite development tool, Delphi from [Embarcadero](https://www.embarcadero.com/) as generated by ChatGPT.

## Delphi, oh Delphi!

###### by ChatGPT

````
Delphi, oh Delphi, the language of might,
With syntax and structure, so bold and so bright,
A master of speed, with code that's so clean,
Programmers flock to it, as its power is seen.

Its versatility, an attribute to boast,
For building applications, it is second to most,
With VCL and FMX, it's a developer's delight,
As it creates interfaces, both simple and bright.

The language of old, yet still relevant today,
With updates to its features, it leads the way,
In a world of new languages, it still stands tall,
A testament to its enduring power, through them all.

So here's to Delphi, the language of choice,
With power and beauty, it remains a strong voice,
In the world of programming, it reigns supreme,
For its developers, it is a coding dream.

For businesses large and small, Delphi provides,
Solutions for their problems, that no one else can divide,
From desktop to mobile, its reach is vast,
With Delphi, success is ensured, at any task.

So let us sing the praises, of this language divine,
For Delphi, our champion, shall always shine,
A beacon of hope, in an ever-changing tech,
For those who use it, it will always be their best bet.
