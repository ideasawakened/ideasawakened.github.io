I received a notification from Twitter that I was invited to start a Twitter Community so I did a quick search and did not find any existing Delphi-related communities, so I started a new [Delphi Developers Community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1669876479377776641) on Twitter.  We quickly jumped up to 73 members and everyone is invited to join (and to invite others as well.)

A little while after posting a Tweet about the community, I received a note that Embarcadero already has a Twitter Community available which is currently moderated by Embarcadero employees.  It can be found [here](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1524988443415166979)  I noticed that it had 111 members but it looks like the vast majority of posts over the last few months was from one account that has been restricted.  I decided to keep my new community alive for now and see what sort of traffic it gets.

Some may ask (again) - why _another_ public group? The answer remains the same - because everyone has their own preferences and the world full of wonderful choice. I might setup other groups on other services soon. If you have a suggestion, let me know!

**See you online!**
