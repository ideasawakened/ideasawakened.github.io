There is a brand new Slack workspace with a handful of different Delphi-related channels now available. Everyone is welcomed to freely join today for collaborative discussions on Delphi.

Current channels are dedicated to Third Party tools and components, Delphi related job openings, web development frameworks, devops, and more. New channels will be added over time. There are Spanish and Russian language channels also available with other foreign language channels added on request.

The first user to join was **Dave Nottage** of [**DelphiWorlds.com**](http://delphiworlds.com/) so he gets the first prize entry of a digital pat on the back! Note that he also has a slack channel dedicated to his tools that anyone can join and is available at [**slack.delphiworlds.com**.](https://slack.delphiworlds.com/)

Here is an [**invitation link**](https://join.slack.com/t/delphiprogrammers/shared_invite/zt-plo1a2jr-xaLr7nuzakcgBTi2Ex5Thg) to join the channel. Members can also invite others to join - please do!

See you online!
