Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year filled with inspiration, growth, and, of course, bug-free code!


# ðŸŽµ "O Delphi Night" ðŸŽµ
(To the tune of "O Holy Night")

## Verse 1

O Delphi night, the code is finely running,

Itâ€™s bug-free now, the build has been deployed!

Lines of Pascal, with clarity and meaning,

Our apps take flight, and users are overjoyed.

The IDE, with lights of festive glory,

Hints and insights guide our merry way!


## Chorus
Code in delight! O joyful, festive season!

Write, debug, and dream of what will be.

O Delphi night, the season of creation!

Letâ€™s build, letâ€™s build, with passion and with glee!


## Verse 2
A blinking star atop our Christmas project,

Points to the path where creativity flows.

With each compile, the errors we correct,

And in our hearts, the holiday spirit grows.

The VCL, it shines in splendid wonder,

Forms and classes, working hand in hand!


## Chorus
Code in delight! O joyful, festive season!

Write, debug, and dream of what will be.

O Delphi night, the season of creation!

Letâ€™s build, letâ€™s build, with passion and with glee!


## Bridge
Let every loop run true, let every thread stay safe,

Our memories of coding fill this sacred space!

With TButton and TStringList, our tools become our art,

And in this joyous season, we program from the heart!


## Final Chorus
Code in delight! O joyful, festive season!

Write, debug, and dream of what will be.

O Delphi night, the season of creation!

Letâ€™s build, letâ€™s build, with passion and with glee!
