Embarcadero has recently unleashed [**RAD Studio 11 Alexandria**](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/announcing-the-availability-of-rad-studio-11-alexandria). It is certainly another historic release with great features including a massive amount of effort targeting a high quality IDE experience running in High DPI on 4K monitors. This includes crisp fonts and icons in all windows and the editor, and even includes the new feature of previewing VCL Styles within the form designer! As with all of their recent major releases, it should quickly become the new "gold standard" version to use for Delphi and C++ Builder.

Note that there are still some issues carried over from the prior releases, as covered in a previous blog post "[**RAD Studio 10.4.2 is great, but here are some notes**](https://www.ideasawakened.com/post/rad-studio-10-4-2-is-great-but-here-are-some-notes)". There is still the issue with missing 64-bit Linux browsing path, still have to manually put GetIt into online mode if you use the ISO \`offline\` installer, and not all of the RSP issues listed in that post have been completed, but the most important ones seem to be addressed in this latest release.

As I have done with other recent releases from Embarcadero, I have created a wiki page of links and resources dedicated RAD Studio 11. This can be found on GitHub here: [**https://github.com/ideasawakened/DelphiKB/wiki/D28.ALEXANDRIA.11.0.0.0**](https://github.com/ideasawakened/DelphiKB/wiki/D28.ALEXANDRIA.11.0.0.0)

Within this wiki page, there is a bunch of links regarding this version, some slides captured from the release webinar, and a number of issues that have come up with the release so far have been listed. If you have additions or corrections to any of the content included on this page, please let me know and I will update the page.
