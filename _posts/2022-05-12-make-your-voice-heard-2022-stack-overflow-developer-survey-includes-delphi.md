The 12th annual developer survey from Stack Overflow includes options to select [**Delphi**](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [**RAD Studio**](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio). This is a very popular survey within the developer community with over 80,000 developers participating last year - so let's help represent the Delphi developer!

You do not have to be an active Stack Overflow member to take the survey. The answers are all anonymous. [**Here is a link to the survey**](https://stackoverflow.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5jeoE1pq9sFcwIe). It takes under ten minutes to complete. (Note: the last two sections can simply be skipped... a Demographics section covers personal details that you can just click through and there is an optional "Professional Developer Series" section that you can opt out.)

**As seen below, ensure you select your favorite programming language - Delphi!** (RAD Studio is a selection in a later question.)

It is great to see Delphi on the Developer Survey this year. Let's make the most of it and nudge all of your fellow Delphi developers to take the survey.
