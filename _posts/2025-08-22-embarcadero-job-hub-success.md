## Update

Back in my [original post](https://www.ideasawakened.com/post/embarcadero-job-hub) introducing the new [Embarcadero Job Hub](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/development-jobs), I highlighted their web resource where Delphi developers and employers can connect. At that time, it was really new and just three developers had taken the first step.

Fast forward just a few days after my blog post, and the momentum is quickly building. The Job Hub now features 18 Delphi developers who have published their resumes for potential projects and full-time opportunities. What's also exciting is the global reach already on display â€” developers are available from Germany, Uruguay, Bulgaria, India, Iran, Turkey, Spain, Colombia, Egypt, Brazil, United States, and Madagascar. This makes the Job Hub not only a resource for finding talent, but also a showcase of Delphi's truly international community.

Even better, the system is already proving its value. A German Delphi developer shared with me today on LinkedIn that he has already received two inquiries, and he is likely to secure a contract as a result. That made my day - and provides proof that this resource can help both employers and developers succeed!

If you are a Delphi developer, this is your chance to get noticed. If you are an employer or team leader, you now have direct access to a growing pool of global Delphi talent. The more people who participate, the stronger this ecosystem will become.

## Success

The quick success story is encouraging, and it is worth checking back often as this new platform continues to grow.

Note that **Olaf Monien** responded on my related Facebook post in the [Delphi Developer](https://www.facebook.com/groups/137012246341854) group: 
> There might still be issues, missing features etc. Post your experience here (and mark me). I'll forward your feedback to the responsible person at EMBT

Also note that **Ian Barker** mentioned to me that there he has a customer that really needs a C++ Builder web full time developer, preferably in the USA (in Ohio), but they will consider other places including remote/outsource so let him know if you are available.
