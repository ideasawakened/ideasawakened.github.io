The  first in a series of challenges for the RAD Studio developer community is well underway!  Contestants have started building their own versions of Minesweeper using Delphi and C++Builder. Please support them by giving their GitHub repositories a ‚≠ê and following the authors!

As a reminder from the [initial challenge announcement](https://ideasawakened.com/post/rad-programmer-challenge-number-1-minesweeper-game-build), the submission deadline is April 26, 2025. New entries and code changes are allowed until then. Judging begins April 27, and the winner will be announced shortly after.


## David Reed
- The first entry is from GitHub user [davidreed1666](https://github.com/davidreed1666)  His [entry post](https://github.com/orgs/radprogrammer/discussions/4) was on March 24 and you can find the Minesweeper GitHub Repository [here.](https://github.com/davidreed1666/davidreed/tree/main/Projects/20250323%20Minesweeper)  There has been 4 stars given for this repository so far, tied for first place.

## HemulGM
- The third entry is from GitHub user [HemulGM](https://github.com/HemulGM)  Their [entry post](https://github.com/orgs/radprogrammer/discussions/6) was on March 29 and you can find the Minesweeper GitHub Repository [here.](https://github.com/HemulGM/MineSweeperFMX)  There has been 3 stars given for this repository so far

## AnthonySWest
- A pending entry is from GitHub user [AnthonySWest](https://github.com/AnthonySWest) which currently does not currently have an entry post, but you can find the Minesweeper GitHub Repository [here.](https://github.com/AnthonySWest/sweep-them-mines)  There has been only 1 star given for this repository so far.  This entry is unique as it's developed in C++ rather than Delphi.  He also has a `.githooks` setup to automatically apply formatting to the source which is a plus.

## vhanla
- Another pending entry is from GitHub user [vhanla](https://github.com/vhanla) which currently does not currently have an entry post, but you can find the Minesweeper GitHub Repository [here.](https://github.com/vhanla/MineSweeper)  There has been 7 stars given for this repository so far so he would be in the lead for stars if he officially enters.

## Jim McKeeth
- Jim has posted a message on the [Delphi Praxis forum](https://en.delphipraxis.net/topic/13195-rad-programmer-coding-challenge-1-build-a-minesweeper-game-in-rad-studio-with-a-chance-to-with-500/?do=findComment&comment=102993) that he has a new [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jimmckeeth/MineSweeperHex) in response to this challenge.  His repo is up to 5 stars.  Jim says he has some more ideas to implement to dress up the UI some more and double-click to restart the game.  He is using [Skia4Delphi](https://skia4delphi.org/) and has implemented a unique Hex board layout.

## Marco Cantu
- Marco added a response on [Delphi Praxis](https://en.delphipraxis.net/topic/13195-rad-programmer-coding-challenge-1-build-a-minesweeper-game-in-rad-studio-with-a-chance-to-with-500/?do=findComment&comment=102631) and asked if he could submit his 25-year old version that he wrote for his **Mastering Delphi 5** book written long ago. üòÅ  

Remarkably, his code from 1995 compiles and runs without error with the latest version of RAD Studio 12 Athens, highlighting Delphi‚Äôs impressive backwards compatibility.  Here's a screen shot of some of his source code and his old game board which offers an exploding sound if you land on a mine:

Did you see Marco's recent [blog post](https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2025-march-mastering-delphi5-annotated-complete.html) that he has a fully annotated edition of this book available for a [free download](https://downloads.marcocantu.com/delphi5annotated.pdf)?  This is a great free resource from Marco. The source code which accompanies the Mastering Delphi 5 book is also available on GitHub: [MasterDelphi5 Repo](https://github.com/MarcoDelphiBooks/MasteringDelphi5/tree/51d18693d606d52bf74685e4e407d2ed46398530)

## Alberto Brito
A game in the works that I have seen some discussions on the [Delphi Programming Telegram Server](https://t.me/delphidevelopers) is from Alberto Brito which looks nice:
