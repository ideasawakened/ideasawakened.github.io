As **Marco Cantu** posted earlier on the [Embarcadero Blog](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/update-subscription-customers-invited-to-join-rad-studio-ganymede-beta/), the next version of RAD Studio is now in preparation. If you are an Update Subscription customer, you can join the private Beta program and test your code with RAD Studio 13 Florence before its public release!

By popular demand, Embarcadero has placed a strong emphasis on quality over the last several releases. If you are one of the many developers who have asked for improvements, this is **your chance to participate** in the Quality Improvement Process and help catch bugs **before they ship**.

Due to NDA, I cannot disclose what's included in this Beta - but you can find out for yourself by signing up. I can say that several features under consideration are likely to generate real excitement. Since this is a major release, it is not binary compatible with RAD Studio 12, which means there is room for more impactful changes and larger improvements compared to a minor update.

This is your opportunity to get in early, test your projects, and provide feedback while there is still time to influence the final product.

Just keep in mind: every Beta program showcases potential new features - not everything makes it to the RTM build. Some features may be delayed or dropped based on feedback or development timelines. But the more real-world code and usage the Beta receives, the better the chance of catching regressions early and ensuring the best experience at launch.

If you are a Premium [Update Subscription Customer](https://www.embarcadero.com/update-subscription) active in the Beta program, you will have access to a private online forum dedicated to the Beta release.  All update subscription customers active in the Beta will have access to a special Beta section of the [Quality Portal](https://qp.embarcadero.com/) for filling out bug reports and feature requests for the Beta.  

If you are passionate about improving RAD Studio and want the opportunity to help shape its future, now is the time to get involved. By joining the RAD Studio 13 Florence Beta, you can test your existing code, explore new features early, and provide feedback that could directly influence the final release. Your participation not only helps ensure higher quality and fewer regressions â€” it gives you a voice in the development process. **Don't just wait for the next release - be a part of it!**
